What is a `DataBlock` in fastai?\n","\n","Think of `DataBlock` as a **blueprint** for how your data is transformed into a format that PyTorch models can use.\n","It answers 4 questions:\n","\n","1. **What types of inputs/labels?**\n","   → (`ImageBlock`, `CategoryBlock`, `TextBlock`, etc.)\n","2. **Where to get the items from?**\n","   → `get_items=get_image_files`\n","3. **How to get labels?**\n","   → `get_y=parent_label` (folder name = label)\n","4. **How to split into train/valid?**\n","   → `splitter=RandomSplitter(...)`, `GrandparentSplitter(...)`, or custom logic.\n","\n","On top of that, you can add:\n","\n","* **Transforms before batching** → `item_tfms=Resize(224)`\n","* **Transforms after batching** → `batch_tfms=aug_transforms()`\n","\n","So `DataBlock` is about **declarative setup** — you say *what you want*, and fastai handles the rest.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. Why not just `ImageDataLoaders.from_folder`?\n","\n","* `ImageDataLoaders.from_folder` is a **shortcut** built on top of `DataBlock`.\n","* It’s great for quick experiments (train/valid only).\n","* But it’s limited — if you want **3 splits (train/valid/test)** or unusual labeling logic, it won’t work directly.\n","\n","That’s why I moved to `DataBlock` in the modified Option A. It gives **flexibility**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. Use of `DataBlock` in your PlantVillage case\n","\n","* We need a **custom splitter** (train, valid, test).\n","* We need **flexible transforms** (later you’ll add augmentations like rotation, lighting, flips, etc.).\n","* You want a project that looks **professional** on your portfolio → showing a `DataBlock` setup highlights your control over data processing.\n","\n","So here, `DataBlock` is useful because:\n","\n","* It lets you plug in your **own split logic** (the 3-way split).\n","* It makes it easier to extend later (e.g., add data augmentation).\n","* It avoids manually reorganizing files into `train/valid/test` folders.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. Analogy\n","\n","* `ImageDataLoaders.from_folder` = **auto mode** in a DSLR camera. Quick, convenient, but limited.\n","* `DataBlock` = **manual mode**. You control ISO, shutter, aperture → flexible, professional, but needs more setup.\n","\n","---\n","\n","✅ In summary:\n","We use a `DataBlock` here **only because** you want a **3-way split** (train/valid/test) while keeping files in place.
